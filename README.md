# 📦 Final Assignment: Build, Organize, and Deploy a Multipage Website

You're now ready to bring everything together—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, planning, structure, and deployment. This final project challenges you to **conceptualize, build, and deploy a multi-page website** that is responsive, interactive, and ready for the real world.

This assignment will guide you from planning your site all the way to deploying it online. Let’s make your project *production-worthy*! 🚀

---

## 🌐🎯 Part 1: Planning and Organizing a Multipage Website

Before you write any code, take time to plan:

* Define your website's purpose (portfolio, product showcase, blog, etc.)
* Outline 3–5 pages (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact, Gallery)
* Sketch or describe the layout of each page
* Map out internal navigation (how pages link to one another)

**Goal:** Show intentional structure and user journey across the site.

---

## 🌍💻 Part 2: Build the Website Using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript

Using your plan, begin building:

* Use HTML5 for semantic structure
* Apply CSS for responsive layout, styling, and animations
* Use JavaScript to add interactivity (menus, forms, toggles, dynamic content)

Each page should:

* Be mobile-responsive
* Share a consistent layout/header/footer
* Include at least one interactive element (e.g., form validation, toggle menu, animation on scroll)

**Goal:** Integrate everything you’ve learned in a cohesive, functioning project.

---

## 🛠️🚀 Part 3: Best Practices for Code Organization

Before deployment, refactor your project to follow production-friendly practices:

* Organize files in folders (`/css`, `/js`, `/images`, etc.)
* Write clean, modular, and commented code
* Use meaningful file names and relative paths
* Validate your HTML/CSS and test on different screen sizes

**Goal:** Prepare your codebase to be readable, maintainable, and scalable.

---

## 🌐🚀 Part 4: Introduction to Hosting and Deployment

Once your project is complete, choose a method to **host your site online**.

You can use:

* **GitHub Pages** (great for portfolios and static sites)
* **Netlify** (powerful CI/CD features and easy form support)
* **Vercel** (lightning-fast deployment for frontend projects)

Deploy your project and confirm that:

* All links and scripts work
* It loads properly on mobile and desktop
* It has a clear, shareable URL

**Goal:** Publish your work online and make it accessible to the world.

---

## Deliverables

1. A GitHub repository containing:

   * Your complete project code, properly organized
   * A `README.md` file explaining your project purpose, structure, and live URL
2. A live deployed website (hosted via GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)

---

## Outcome

* Clarity and thoroughness of planning documentation
* Proper use of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript across multiple pages
* Responsive and accessible design
* Clean, well-organized, and commented code
* Successful live deployment with a working link
* Evidence of following best practices
